## CRITICAL: Version Increment Rules

- Always increment the version for any change that affects:
  - Documentation (including rules, changelogs, release notes, or process docs)
  - Development or deployment processes
  - Build procedures or scripts
  - Project structure or file organization
- Use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation/process-only changes, or non-breaking improvements
- MINOR: New features, enhancements, or significant process changes
- MAJOR: Breaking changes or major overhauls

### Version Checklist
- [ ] Review all changes since last release
- [ ] Update `version.json` with new version, date, and summary
- [ ] Run `npm run version-sync` to propagate version
- [ ] Run `npm test` to verify version consistency
- [ ] Update documentation and changelogs as needed
- [ ] Commit and push all changes before merging to production

## General Process Compliance
- All documentation and process changes must be reflected in the changelog and release notes.
- All deployments must pass the pre-deployment checklist.
- All version numbers must be consistent across `version.json`, `package.json`, and `manifest.json`.
- No future dates are allowed in documentation or version files.
- All rules in this file are mandatory for all contributors.
