# Time Tracker Development Rules

## CRITICAL: Always Review Lessons Learned (NEW RULE)
- **BEFORE making ANY changes**, read `docs/development/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
- **ALWAYS** consider patterns and mistakes from previous development
- **IMPLEMENT** established best practices for validation, error handling, and data integrity
- **ADD NEW LESSONS** to the file when discovering issues or implementing fixes
- **USE ESTABLISHED** UI/UX patterns and validation rules from lessons learned
- **FOLLOW** testing checklists and development guidelines in lessons learned

## CRITICAL: Document Management Consistency (NEW RULE)
- **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**: `docs/development/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` is the ONLY lessons learned file
- **BEFORE CREATING** any new documentation file, CHECK if one already exists
- **SEARCH PROJECT** for existing documents before creating duplicates
- **MERGE CONTENT** into existing files rather than creating new ones
- **UPDATE REFERENCES** in .cursorrules and other files when moving/merging docs
- **DOCUMENT LOCATIONS**: Maintain awareness of where all project documents are located

## Vibe Coding Philosophy & Simplicity First (NEW RULE)
- **SIMPLICITY OVER SOPHISTICATION**: Choose the simple, predictable solution over complex auto-magic
- **EXPLICIT USER ACTIONS**: Prefer clear user-triggered actions (buttons) over auto-save complexity
- **FAIL FAST WITH CLEAR FEEDBACK**: When things go wrong, show clear messages and recovery options
- **SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY**: Each function should do one thing well
- **READABLE CODE PATHS**: Code should be easy to follow - prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- **VIBE CODING REALITY**: We're building this collaboratively with AI - optimize for understanding and maintainability
- **WHEN IN DOUBT, SIMPLIFY**: If a feature seems complex to implement or debug, consider a simpler approach
- **TEST THE HAPPY PATH FIRST**: Get basic functionality rock-solid before adding sophistication
- **AVOID PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION**: Don't add complexity until there's a proven need

## Development Workflow & Version Management (CRITICAL NEW RULE)
### Keep version numbers consistent across all files
### During Development (Local Testing)
- **NEVER** increment version numbers during local development/testing
- **TRACK ALL CHANGES** in `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_CHANGELOG.md`
- **USE CURRENT VERSION** (5.3.0) for all local testing
- **DOCUMENT** issues being worked on and investigation findings
- **ADD** all modifications to "Current Development Cycle" section

### Ready for Deployment (Version Increment Time)
- **REVIEW** all accumulated changes in development changelog
- **CHOOSE** appropriate version increment (patch/minor/major)
- **UPDATE** `version.json` with new version and ALL accumulated changes
- **UPDATE** `docs/project-management/RELEASE_NOTES.md` with comprehensive changelog
- **UPDATE** `docs/development/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` if fixing bugs or issues
- **CLEAR** "Current Development Cycle" and start new section in development changelog
- **RUN** `npm test` to verify version consistency
- **DEPLOY** to staging then production

## Service Worker Cache Management (CRITICAL NEW RULE - v5.3.2)
- **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY**: Service worker CACHE_VERSION MUST be updated whenever app version changes
- **NAMING CONVENTION**: Use format `vX.Y.Z-descriptive-suffix` (e.g., `v5.3.2-cache-fix`)
- **SYNCHRONIZATION CHECK**: Verify CACHE_VERSION matches version.json before ANY deployment
- **CONSOLE LOGS**: Update all service worker console.log messages to reflect new version
- **TESTING REQUIREMENT**: Verify cache invalidation works by checking all files update together
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Always document service worker changes in version.json filesModified
- **PREVENTION**: This rule prevents partial deployments and mixed app states

## Storage Technology Evaluation (NEW RULE)
- **BEFORE adding data-heavy features**: Evaluate localStorage vs IndexedDB
- **USE localStorage WHEN**: Simple key-value storage, < 5MB data, synchronous operations preferred
- **CONSIDER IndexedDB WHEN**: Complex queries needed, large datasets (>5MB), async operations acceptable
- **TRIGGER EVALUATION FOR**: Search/filter features, offline sync, large import/export, historical data analysis
- **DOCUMENT DECISION**: Always document why storage technology was chosen in lessons learned

## Mandatory Documentation Discovery Process (NEW RULE)
- **FIRST**: Check `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTS.md` inventory for existing documents
- **BEFORE ANY WORK**: Search entire project for existing documentation on the topic
- **SEARCH COMMANDS**: Use file_search tool to find existing docs before creating new ones
- **SEARCH PATTERNS**: Look for variations like "lesson", "guide", "readme", "doc", "note"
- **CHECK DIRECTORIES**: Always explore docs/ subdirectories thoroughly
- **VERIFY UNIQUENESS**: Confirm no similar document exists before creating new ones
- **UPDATE EXISTING**: Prefer updating existing docs over creating new ones
- **UPDATE INVENTORY**: Add new documents to `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTS.md` when created

### Version Format Rules
- **Development**: Keep version.json at current release version (5.2.6)
- **Deployment**: Increment to next version (5.2.7, 5.3.0, 6.0.0)
- **NEVER** update version numbers in JavaScript files - use version.json only
- Version format: "X.Y.Z - Brief Description"
- Include comprehensive features list from development changelog
- Update timestamp in ISO format

## Netlify Deployment (CRITICAL)
- **Staging:** https://staging-alona-time-tracking.netlify.app/ (main branch)
- **Production:** https://alonastimetracking.netlify.app/ (production branch)
- **ALWAYS** test on staging before pushing to production
- **NEVER** push directly to production without staging verification
- Check Netlify build logs if deployment issues occur
- Clear browser cache and test on multiple devices before confirming deployment

## Documentation Requirements (CRITICAL)
### During Development
- **ALWAYS** update `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_CHANGELOG.md` for any changes
- **TRACK** all issues, investigation notes, and modifications
- **DOCUMENT** debugging findings and solution attempts

### Ready for Deployment
- **CONSOLIDATE** all development changelog items into version.json
- **UPDATE** `docs/project-management/RELEASE_NOTES.md` with comprehensive details
- **UPDATE** `docs/development/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` for any bug fixes or learnings
- **CLEAR** development changelog and prepare for next cycle

## Data Integrity & Validation Rules (FROM LESSONS LEARNED)
- **ALWAYS** validate input at multiple levels: Client-side, function-level, and storage-level
- **NEVER** allow empty required fields to be saved, even in auto-save scenarios
- **VALIDATE** data existence before operations: Check if categories/activities still exist
- **IMPLEMENT** graceful degradation: Handle corrupted data without crashing the UI
- **USE** try-catch blocks for data operations with user-friendly error messages
- **PROVIDE** recovery mechanisms: Always offer a way to fix or restore corrupted data

## Auto-Save Best Practices (FROM LESSONS LEARNED)
- **DEBOUNCE** auto-save operations to prevent excessive calls during user input
- **VALIDATE** before auto-saving: Don't save invalid data automatically
- **PROVIDE** clear feedback: Show saving/saved/error states to users
- **HANDLE** auto-save failures gracefully: Reset form to last known good state
- **NEVER** clear editing state during auto-save operations
- **DISTINGUISH** between intermediate operations and final submissions

## UI Consistency Requirements (FROM LESSONS LEARNED)
- **ALWAYS** refresh displays after data changes: Don't assume users will navigate away
- **PROVIDE** immediate feedback: Users should see their changes instantly
- **HANDLE** modal cleanup properly: Clear state and refresh displays on close
- **TEST** edit flows thoroughly: Especially auto-save and validation scenarios
- **USE** established field-level save status indicators (saving/saved/error)

## Complete Publication Workflow (MANDATORY)
When user requests "publish to staging and production":
1. **Consolidate Development Changes:**
   - Review all items in `DEVELOPMENT_CHANGELOG.md`
   - Choose appropriate version increment
   - Update `version.json` with new version and all accumulated features/fixes

2. **Update Documentation:**
   - Add comprehensive entry to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
   - Add entry to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` if fixing bugs or issues
   - Clear development changelog and start new cycle

3. **Deploy:**
   - Run `npm test` to verify version consistency
   - Commit changes with descriptive message: "vX.Y.Z - Brief description"
   - Push to main branch (auto-deploys to staging)
   - Test staging thoroughly
   - Push to production branch (auto-deploys to production)
   - Verify production deployment

## Pre-Deployment Testing (MANDATORY)
- **RUN** `npm test` to verify version consistency and file structure
- **TEST** in incognito/private browser to avoid cache issues
- **CHECK** console for errors before deployment
- **TEST** all major functionality before pushing
- **TEST** on mobile devices
- **CLEAR** browser cache and retest
- **FOLLOW** testing checklists from lessons learned

## Automated Testing (REQUIREMENT)
- **RUN** `npm test` before any deployment (not required for local development)
- **FIX** any failing tests before proceeding with deployment
- **UPDATE** test-runner.js if adding new critical files or patterns
- **USE** tests to catch version inconsistencies automatically

## Code Quality Standards
- Use consistent CSS variables from components.css design tokens
- Consolidate CSS - avoid duplicates
- Mobile-first responsive design (min 320px width)
- Touch targets minimum 44px for accessibility
- Test on mobile devices for all UI changes
- Maintain visual consistency between components

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow existing design patterns and color schemes
- Maintain consistency between home page and management interfaces
- Use proper loading states and user feedback
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Test click-to-edit functionality thoroughly
- Ensure proper autosave behavior

## Mobile Optimization
- Test all changes on mobile devices
- Ensure touch targets are adequate (44px minimum)
- Verify text readability and emoji sizes
- Check button spacing and layout on small screens
- Test gesture interactions and responsiveness

## Git/PowerShell Best Practices
- Use simple, single commands instead of compound commands
- Avoid interactive git commands that can hang
- Never use git reset/checkout commands that delete directories
- Use force push only in emergencies with extreme caution
- Test git commands in small steps

## Emergency Procedures
- If production breaks: **immediately test locally first**
- If console errors: **fix JavaScript before deployment attempts**
- If deployment issues: **use simple git commands only**
- Document all emergency actions taken in LESSONS_LEARNED.md
