# Cursor AI Rules for Time Tracker Project

## Documentation Maintenance Priority
- ALWAYS check and update documentation files after ANY changes
- Required files: BACKLOG.md, LESSONS_LEARNED.md, CONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Read AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md at the start of each session

## Design Standards
- Use CSS custom properties (design tokens) for all styling
- Follow component class patterns (.btn-base, .input-base)
- Maintain 95% consistency score established in Phase 6

## Development Patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- localStorage for data persistence
- PWA best practices

## Current Status
- Phase 6 completed (v5.1.4+ with streak fix)
- Deployed on Netlify with auto-deployment
- Ready for Phase 7 development

## Critical: Update documentation immediately after code changes
