# 🚀 Deployment Workflow Guide

## 🔄 **Branch Strategy**

### **Development → Staging (Automatic)**
```bash
# Make changes on main branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin main
# ✅ Auto-deploys to https://staging-alona-time-tracking.netlify.app/
```

### **Staging → Production (Manual Approval)**
```bash
# Use deployment script for safety
.\scripts\deploy-to-production.ps1
# ✅ Shows changes, asks approval, deploys to production
```

## 🎯 **Deployment Checklist**

### **Before Production Deployment:**
- [ ] All features tested on staging site
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] PWA functionality intact (install, offline)
- [ ] Goals/streak calculations working correctly
- [ ] Performance acceptable on mobile devices

### **After Production Deployment:**
- [ ] Production site loads correctly
- [ ] All features functional
- [ ] PWA install/update working
- [ ] No broken links or errors
- [ ] Service worker updating properly

## 🏗️ **Site Configuration**

### **Staging Site:**
- **URL**: https://staging-alona-time-tracking.netlify.app/
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Test all changes before production

### **Production Site:**
- **URL**: https://alona-time-tracking.netlify.app/ (or your domain)
- **Branch**: `production`
- **Purpose**: Live user-facing site

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Rollback Production:**
```bash
git checkout production
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force-with-lease origin production
```

### **Hotfix Process:**
```bash
git checkout production
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
# Apply fix and test
git checkout production
git merge hotfix/critical-issue
git push origin production
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-issue
```

## 📋 **Documentation Updates**

After deployment, update:
- `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Reflect current deployment status
- `docs/project-management/RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Document deployed changes
- `docs/project-management/BACKLOG.md` - Mark completed features
