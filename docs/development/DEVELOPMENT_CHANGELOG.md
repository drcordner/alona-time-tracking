## Current Development Cycle (v5.3.2 development) - New Issues/Changes

### Issues Being Investigated
(None currently)

### Changes Made
1. **Enhanced Data Recovery & Error Handling** (In Progress):
   - Problem: "Data Corruption Detected" error showing when editing category names, especially with duplicates
   - Root cause: Overly aggressive error detection treating missing category data as corruption
   - Solutions implemented:
     - Replaced "Data Corruption Detected" with intelligent data recovery attempt
     - Added automatic refresh of category data before showing error
     - User-friendly error message with recovery options (Return to Home, Refresh App)
     - Improved duplicate name handling with better user guidance
     - Added current category reference updating when category is renamed
   - Files modified: js/app.js (showActivities method), js/management.js (updateCategory and submitCategoryForm methods)

### Testing Notes
- Need to test category renaming scenarios on staging
- Test duplicate name handling flows
- Verify data recovery works in various scenarios
