# Development Changelog

This file tracks all changes, issues, and improvements during the current development cycle before they are consolidated into a formal release.

## Current Development Cycle (v5.3.4 development) - New Issues/Changes

### Issues Being Investigated
- **README.md Version Inconsistency**: README.md was showing v5.1.0 while actual version is v5.3.3
- **Hard-coded Version Numbers**: Multiple files (app.js, manifest.json, sw.js) had hard-coded version numbers

### Changes Made
1. **Updated README.md for Version Consistency** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: README.md was showing version 5.1.0 while we're on 5.3.3
   - Solution: Updated version numbers, badges, and version history
   - Added comprehensive version history for all releases since 5.1.0
   - Removed duplicate version history section
   - Files modified: README.md

2. **Added Cursor Rules for README Maintenance** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: No formal process for keeping README.md updated during version increments
   - Solution: Added specific cursor rules to update README.md during deployments
   - Added README.md updates to pre-deployment checklist
   - Files modified: .cursorrules
   
3. **Updated Project Documents Inventory** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: README.md wasn't listed as a critical document requiring updates
   - Solution: Added README.md to documents table and single sources of truth
   - Files modified: docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTS.md

4. **Implemented Single Source of Truth for Version Numbers** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: Version numbers were hard-coded in multiple files (app.js, manifest.json, sw.js)
   - Solution: Created centralized version-loader.js module to provide version information
   - Created version-sync.js script to automatically update all version references
   - Updated all hard-coded references to use the centralized version system
   - Added npm scripts for version synchronization (npm run version-sync)
   - Enhanced test suite to verify version consistency across all files
   - Files created: js/version-loader.js, scripts/version-sync.js
   - Files modified: app.js, management.js, ux-enhancements.js, sw.js, manifest.json, package.json, test-runner.js, .cursorrules

## Workbox Integration (In Progress)
- Simplified service worker implementation using Workbox
- Maintained version synchronization system
- Added automated cache cleanup
- Improved offline support
- Files modified:
  - Added: workbox-config.js, sw-template.js
  - Modified: package.json, scripts/version-sync.js, test-runner.js
  - Added Workbox dependencies
