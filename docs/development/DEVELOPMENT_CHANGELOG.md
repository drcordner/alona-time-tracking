# Development Changelog

This file tracks all changes, issues, and improvements during the current development cycle before they are consolidated into a formal release.

## Current Development Cycle (v5.3.3 development) - New Issues/Changes

### Issues Being Investigated
- **Service Worker Not Registering**: Service worker registration was disabled in app.js preventing cache version updates from taking effect

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed Service Worker Registration** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: Service worker registration was commented out in app.js since v5.3.0 cache buster implementation
   - Impact: Cache version updates in sw.js had no effect because service worker wasn't running
   - Solution: Re-enabled service worker registration with proper sw.js file reference
   - Files modified: js/app.js (registerServiceWorker method)

2. **Enhanced Check for Updates Functionality** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: Basic cache clearing wasn't aggressive enough for PWA installations
   - Enhancement: Added version checking, user confirmation, and more aggressive cache clearing
   - Features: Shows actual update availability, confirms force refresh, preserves user data
   - Files modified: js/management.js (checkForUpdates method)

3. **Added Nuclear Cache Reset Option** (COMPLETED):
   - Problem: Extreme cache issues needed more aggressive solution than regular updates
   - Solution: Added "Nuclear Reset" button that clears ALL caches, localStorage, service workers
   - Safety: Preserves user data (time tracking, settings, categories) while nuking everything else
   - Files modified: js/management.js (added nuclearCacheReset method and UI button)
