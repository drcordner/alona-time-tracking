## 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY BUG FIXES** *(Target: v5.2.2 - NEXT RELEASE)*

**🎯 RELEASE GOAL:** Fix all mobile UX and navigation issues for seamless user experience

### 📱 **Mobile UX Critical Issues (RELEASE BLOCKERS)**
- [ ] **🔄 Emoji Selector Scroll Issue** ⭐ **v5.2.2 TARGET**
  - **Problem**: When using emoji selector on mobile, page scrolls behind popup instead of scrolling through emojis
  - **Impact**: Cannot browse emoji options on touch devices - BREAKS editing on mobile
  - **Platform**: Mobile touch devices specifically  
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Core functionality broken on primary platform
  - **Files Affected**: `js/management.js` (emoji picker implementation), `css/components.css`
  - **Solution**: Implement proper touch event handling, prevent body scroll, use scroll-lock
  - **Effort**: Small (1-2 days)

- [ ] **⚙️ Mobile Edit Button Visibility** ⭐ **v5.2.2 TARGET**
  - **Problem**: Hover-based edit cogs are difficult to trigger on mobile - requires tap and hold
  - **Impact**: Poor editing UX on mobile devices (primary platform)
  - **Locations**: Home page category edit, activity list edit buttons
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Core functionality accessibility issue
  - **Solution Strategy**: 
    - Make edit cogs always visible on mobile devices
    - Add dedicated "Edit" button to category/activity cards

  - **Impact**: Users lose context of which category they're in
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Navigation confusion affects usability
  - **Solution**: Add category header with name, emoji, and color
  - **Files Affected**: `js/app.js` (showActivities method, lines 280-300)
  - **Effort**: Small (1 day)

- [ ] **⚡ Activity Screen Missing Quick Actions** ⭐ **v5.2.2 TARGET**
  - **Problem**: No way to "quick edit" category or "quick add" activity from activity list
  - **Impact**: Requires navigation to Management screen for simple edits
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Workflow efficiency improvement
  - **Solution Strategy**:
    - Add category edit button to activity screen header  
    - Add floating "+" button for quick activity addition

  - **Impact**: Layout breaks, poor mobile experience
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Visual consistency issue on primary platform
  - **Current Stats**: Today, This Week, This Month, Categories Count, Average  
  - **Solution**: 
    - Remove "Categories Count" (low value metric)
    - Remove "Average" (confusing/meaningless to users)
    - Keep: Today, This Week, This Month
    - Add: All Time (more valuable than count)
  - **Files Affected**: `js/reports.js` (lines 900-930), `css/components.css`
