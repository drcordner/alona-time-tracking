# Alona's Enhanced Time Tracker

## Phase 1 Enhancements ✨

### 🚀 New Features

#### 1. Timer Persistence & Recovery
- **Problem Solved**: Timer continues running even if you accidentally close/refresh the app
- **How it works**: Timer state is saved to localStorage and recovered on app restart
- **Test**: Start a timer, close the browser tab, reopen → you'll get a recovery prompt

- **Features**: 
  - Visual status indicator (▶️ Running / ⏸️ Paused)

  - Accurate time tracking excluding paused periods

#### 3. Navigation Protection 🔒
